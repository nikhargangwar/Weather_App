# Weather_App

I built my first web application called 'Weather App'.

APPLICAION LINK - https://lnkd.in/dkQJN8z

It provides you the weather condition and temperature of the entered location. It also displays messages like 'unable to find the location' or 'you must provide location'.
if the user forgot or entered an incorrect location.

I fetched APIs with the help of Node.js. APIs for weather forecasting and geocoding were taken from mapbox.com and openweathermap.org.

I used HTML/CSS for client-side part and javascript ,node.js & express.js for server-side part. I deployed it on Heroku.
